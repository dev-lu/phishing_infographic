# Phishing infographic


Phishing is one of the biggest cyber threats these days. Companies often struggle to make their employees aware of phishing and teach them to recognize phishing emails. That’s why I’ve created an infographic that companies can use to teach their employees succinctly what’s important. All icons used in this graphic originate from Google fonts and are free for commercial use and need no copyright notice. Your company logo can be inserted in the upper right corner.

I also made a black and white version to fit to almost every corporate identity. If you need custom coloring feel free to reach out to me!

You can download the infographic as a PDF at the end of the document containing versions in english and german.
